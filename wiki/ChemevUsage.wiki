#summary This wiki describes how to achieve all our results with chemev.

= Introduction =

First install chemev using the installation instructions (see the main page).

= 117-isochrone fit =

This fits the CMD with a restricted set of 117 isochrones and we are interested in the best fit. 

It's kind of technical, as it is not really easy to get the best fit just by naively executing some fittig algorithm. Some experience needs to be employed.

The best fit for halo, that Ondrej was ever able to achieve is around: -558,000

Now we are writing a script to get this result automatically.

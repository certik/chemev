#summary This wiki describes how to achieve all our results with chemev.

= Introduction =

First install chemev using the installation instructions (see the main page).

= 117-isochrone fit =

This fits the CMD with a restricted set of 117 isochrones and we are interested in the best fit. 

It's kind of technical, as it is not really easy to get the best fit just by naively executing some fittig algorithm. Some experience needs to be employed.

The best fit for halo, that Ondrej was able to achieve is: -558047.711479 (~8060.2 in Tom's units). Tom's best value is 8063.4943.

To calculate the best fit using the *simplex* method:

{{{
cd chemev/calc/halosimplex-automatic/
python 117isofit.py
}}}

and wait couple of hours. :) You'll get the bestfit of around -558,000 (~8155 in Tom's units). 

In the first 15 minutes, you'll get the likelihood of around -557938 (8279 in Tom's units), in 30 minutes: -558000.460779 tom: 8154.70522397, then in the following hours it progresses very slowly up to the best fit, which is around 8060 in Tom's units.

A superior method to simplex is a *BFGS* (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFGS_method) method. Implemented by http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html. With this method, we can achieve the best fit

henry: -558047.711479 tom: 8060.20382375

in less than 7 minutes.
